    title: "What is Altruism?",
    text: `Altruism is an ill-defined term with differing meanings in fields including philosophy, psychology, and biology. This game focuses on definition of an altruistic behavior commonly used in evolutionary biology, “a behavior resulting in a net reduction of the survival and/or reproduction of an actor to benefit a recipient” (Kay et al., 2020). `,

  WhyAltruism: {
    title: "Why Altruism?",
    text: `Altruism is a needed ingredient for cooperation, which is foundational to forming more complex structures at each level of organization, from the emergence of genomes and cells to macroscopic forms like social orders in insects and humans (Nowak, 2006). Given natural selection is inherently competitive, acts of altruism are notoriously difficult to explain under the traditional Darwinian framework. Why would an individual lower their own reproductive potential to assist another? It seems plausible that the gene that encodes for such an altruistic behavior would be selected against in favor of a more “selfish” gene. This is the idea this game will explore.`,

  Eusocial: {
    title: "Eusocial Species Focus",
    text: `Given the difficulty of explanation, multiple competing theories have developed over time to explain various forms of altruistic behavior. Altruism has been evidenced in many species, but all the possibilities would be too many to enumerate. This game will focus on theories for altruistic behavior applied to eusocial species, which E.O. Wilson defines as “animals that live in multigenerational communities, practice division of labor and behave altruistically” (Angier, 2012). Among these species are bees and ants, frequently studied by modern evolutionary biologists and importantly the same group of species that initially perplexed Charles Darwin for the existence of sterile workers which would only serve a central queen.`,

  GameOverview: {
    title: "Game Overview",
    text: `Now, onto the game! In this game, you’ll be taken along a journey of evolutionary theories explaining altruism starting from the time of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (circa ~1850) to a subset of modern theories (circa ~2010s). Along the way, you’ll be presented with summaries and data from articles at that time period, using which you’ll periodically decide which “scientific camp” at that time you would subscribe to. After completing these series of readings and decision points, you’ll receive a summary of your decisions and an overview of which notable evolutionary biologists throughout time would have agreed with you! `,

  Rules: {
    title: "The Rules",
    text: `The rules of the game are: Read the provided background information pages which outline the views of different evolutionary biologists at a given time. Periodically make decisions on which group of biologists at that time you’d subscribe to. At the end of the game, see which groups of biologists you would have agreed most with! 

    Before we start, remember to relax your existing scientific notions on altruism. The historical theorists did not have the expanse of modern experimental evidence that informs our current opinions, so do your best with the provided information.
    
    With that, let's embark!
